//! # PolicySpec Types
//!
//! Soroban-native types representing the spending policy specification.
//! These match the JSON schema produced by `policy-generator/schema.py`,
//! but use `#[contracttype]` for on-chain XDR serialization.
//!
//! The Python generator produces JSON; the deploy script or MCP server
//! converts that JSON into these Soroban-native types before calling
//! `apply_policy`.
